# ChromiumChat

### *Beta preview*

**ChromiumChat is a voice- and text-chat application built on repl.it for repl.it users, using node.js.** Basically a cheap Discord knockoff.

Polyphony is currently in development (see [the repl](https://repl.it/@19wintersp/Polyphony)) and so this site is used to test technologies. (the original thing was by @19wintersp, remixed by @dudeactualdev)

Enjoy! **ãƒ„**

*and for the love of god, please don't be profane!*

## How to use

### **Important: the site doesn't work on most mobile browsers**

Go to [the site](https://polyphonypreview.19wintersp.repl.co/) and you'll be automatically connected to the text chat.

The chat is global, so anyone else on the site can chat to you. Messages are not saved, unlike in the final version of ChromiumChat.

To use the voice chat, click "Connect" and "Unmute self" under the "Voice chat" section. This audio room is also global.

## Extra information

THIS IS A TESTING GROUND. The final site will look at least a little bit more polished.

All of these use WebSockets to communicate with the server. If your browser does not support WebSockets or ES6, the site will not work.

An API might be available with the final version of ChromiumChat. If you want to steal my code, I'd ask for attribution, but I can't really stop you.
